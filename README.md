# Welcome to the source files for my website!

It's currently being hosted on github pages, and you can find it [here](https://theloganaut.github.io/)

Any questions or thoughts you have feel free to email them to theLoganaut@gmail.com. Hire me quick before someone else does!

This is the simpliest version of a personal portfolio website I could come up with. My
creativity knows no bounds, but I was able to settle on something finally.

However you got here, I hope you liked what you've seen.

And I guess whoever you are, wherever you are, stay curious.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The falling icon animation was made with a custom [tsParticles](https://particles.js.org/) configuration, specifically [snowing](https://particles.js.org/samples/index.html#snow).

Emailing currently handled by [PostMail](https://postmail.invotes.com/) but I will be changing this to a more customizable and secure version in the future.

All icons were made by me, I realized they're pretty good so please feel free to email me for a discussion on me making you one!
